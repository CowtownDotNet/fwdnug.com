                <h3>Topic:&nbsp; Functional Programming in F#</h3>
                <p>
                    The world operates in functions. Everyday we perform numerous small tasks that lead to some kind of output. That output is then used as an input to another task to produce a different output. Functional Programming is the practice of slicing a problem into smaller consumable units of work so that the connections of inputs to outputs can be pictured simply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will explore the fundamentals of thinking as a Functional Programmer, introduce key concepts of the F# language, code an F# solution quickly, and refactor for beautification and simplicity.

                <div>
                    <p>
                        With all the talk about big data, Internet of things, and the value that can be derived from the analysis of all of that information, no one seems to talk about how we collect it. There are a number of traditional ways. Those ways usually have problems with how to handle data spikes, durability, and distribution for processing. Azure Event Hubs may be an answer to part of those problems. We will go over what they are, how to set them up, the costs, and the various ways to send and receive information.

                <h3>Topic:&nbsp; The Git Parable</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Are you baffled by the community's obsession with Git? Do your knees tremble at the thought of encountering a merge conflict, or even worse: getting thrown into "detached head" state? When a new team says they're using Git, do you wonder why they're turning up their noses at the centralized VCS you know? Everybody understands adding, committing, pushing and pulling; but trying to understand Git with the same paradigm as you approach centralized version control systems is a recipe for fear, uncertainty & doubt. Git doesn't work like a centralized version control system, which can be confusing. If you want to understand how Git truly IS different, this session is for you. Git becomes much easier to understand, once you approach it with the understanding that it's fundamentally different from a centralized VCS. The goal of this talk is to shed some light on how Git works under the hood. To develop a mental model of how Git works, we'll start with, "The Git Parable," by Tom Preston-Warner. We'll take a look at some of Git’s core concepts including its basic object storage, how commits work, how branches and tags work, and we’ll look at the different kinds of merging in Git (yes, including rebase). You’ll walk away with a better understanding of these concepts, able to use Git with more confidence.

                    <p>
                        We will spend some time discussing what Windows 10 is and why it is important to get involved early with developing Universal Windows Applications (UWA). We will cover what it means to be a UWA application and what kinds of things can you do with UWA across desktop, tablet, phone, Xbox One, Hololens and even the Raspberry Pi 2... to name but a few devices that UWA currently targets.

In this specific application, I transitioned from pure WinForms to a hybrid application leveraging Portable Class Libraries (PCL). Because of this I not only was able to transition between these different platforms, I am able to continue supporting all of them from within Visual Studio 2015.

                    <p>
                        If you are paying close attention to the front-end web development space, you have probably heard of things like Gulp and Grunt.
                        Both are build systems/tasks runners. These sound terribly boring but in reality they are very handy tools.
                        In this meetup we will focus on using one of them (Gulp) and how it can help us solve a number of problems in web development.
                        Along the way we'll also discuss Node, NPM, Bower, JSX, Typescript, ES6, Browserify, Web Pack, SASS, JavaScript unit-testing automation, et al.
                        So if you aren't already familiar with all these tools, I'll show you how you can use them to help you in your web development.

                <div>
                    <p>
                        You've seen them. Those really big view models that take on far too much responsibility. They send messages to other view models, they call services, and they run business logic. It's really hard to understand how these things work, and even harder to avoid breaking them when they need to change.

                        See how the message bus pattern -- far from its original intent -- is actually coupling your view models. See why business logic always seems to end up in the wrong layer. And most importantly, learn a better alternative.

                        Writing clean view models is easy, but only if you have the tools to help you.

Michael L Perry has built upon the works of mathematicians like Bertrand Meyer, Leslie Lamport, and Donald Knuth to develop a mathematical system for software development. He has captured this system in a set of open source projects, Assisticant and Correspondence. He teaches this system in the Q.E.D. Code podcast, and on several Pluralsight courses including Cryptography Fundamentals and Patterns for Building Distributed Systems for the Enterprise. As a Principal Consultant at Improving Enterprises, he applies mathematical concepts to building scalable and robust enterprise systems. You can find out more at qedcode.com.

                    <p>
                        Web development was a different game back in the early 2000s. Early versions of ASP.NET were aimed at Microsoft's existing customer base, and even tried to hide the nature of the web from developers who weren't ready for it. The platform has evolved steadily since the .NET Framework was released, but many of the technical decisions made early in ASP.NET's life don't make sense in the context of modern web development. By cutting loose some of the baggage from earlier versions, the ASP.NET team has been able to make sweeping changes to bring the framework in line with its lightweight, agile contemporaries. In this presentation, Brian will show how the next version of ASP.NET will be leaner and more flexible than the platform has ever been. Topics covered will include the new command line tools, changes to Visual Studio, cross-platform usage, tag helpers, view components, and more.

He jumped at the opportunity to help transition some of those COBOL applications to .NET, and he hasn’t looked back since. He has been working with Microsoft technologies since the .NET 1.0 days, and is interested in introducing modern web development techniques to the clients he works with.

                        <br />
                        To follow along, you will need to bring a laptop with the following installed:<br />
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs">Visual Studio 2013</a> (Express Editions will work)</li>
                            <li><a href="http://netmf.codeplex.com/">NET Micro Framework SDK v4.3 (QFE2-RTM)</a></li>
                        </ul>
                        <br />
                        We will be providing the hardware components needed for the hands-on lab.<br />
                        There is also a pretty good chance that we will be giving a Netduino away!

                        Xamarin allows you to put your C# expertise to work on Android and iOS. Previously, you had to know Objective-C and Java to write native applications. Xamarin apps are built with standard, native user interface controls. Apps look and behave as users expect them.

                <h3>Topic:&nbsp; What's New in Visual Studio 2015 and C# 6?</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        At this year's Microsoft Connect() event in New York City, Scott Guthrie gave
                        developers all over the world a quick taste of Visual Studio 2015 and C# 6. In
                        this hands-on session, Casey Watson digs a little bit deeper and goes into even
                        greater detail about what these updates mean to you. Included in this session
                        will be a demonstration of some of the debugging improvements that have been
                        made in Visual Studio 2015, "Smart Unit Tests" and some great new C# language
                        features. If you are interested in the future of development with Visual Studio
                        you owe it to yourself to attend this session. If you would like to follow
                        along, be sure to grab Visual Studio 2015 for free at
                        http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/visual-studio-2015-downloads-vs

                    <p>
                        Casey Watson is a dedicated husband, proud father, community organizer and
                        Senior Program Manager at Microsoft. Casey believes that is the responsibility
                        of every serious developer to constantly "sharpen their saw" through both
                        reading and community involvement and is a strong advocate of SOLID development
                        practices. Over the last decade, he has been focused primarily on the .NET
                        platform but has recently focused on building cloud-based applications on the
                        Microsoft Azure platform. Casey is heavily involved in the local development
                        community having spoken at and organized several user groups and conferences
                        across the United States including Cowtown Code Camp, Dallas TechFest and Tulsa
                        TechFest. When not learning about, speaking on, writing about or building
                        software, he can be found spending time with his family, updating his Twitter
                        status (@_caseywatson), or enjoying an ice cold bottle of Blue Moon.

                        In order to (continue) answer this “age old question”, we will be holding our December 2014 meeting Tuesday December 16th (6:30p-9p) at:

                        The games are 8 minutes each for up to 10 people at a time.  We will be covering all of the games for 2 hours.
                        There will be pizza (as usual) and we will be covering the first beverage of your choice (beer, wine, soda).
                        This proved to be a fun and interactive experience!  So don’t miss out!
                        Also, if you do not wish to participate in the active portion of this event, please feel free to attend for the networking side (and the, I’m sure, laughter that will sure be).
                        I did mention… beer, right?
                        As usual, for events like this, the event will have a $10 (plus eventbright.com fee) to secure your spot.  The collected $10 will be donated 100% to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (stjude.org).

                        Note: This is a private invite to members of our community (specifically our user group, our sponsors and our peers of other user groups in the area).  Because of this, this particular meeting on eventbrite is "private"; however, please feel free to share through various social networks to help spread the word within our community.
                        As I've had a few people ask... I've enable the dontation option for those of you that aren't able to make the event but would like to put something toward the resulting donation to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital care of the "Fort Worth .NET Users Group".

                                Last month we saw the beginning of a project being worked on by one of our own (Pete).  He demonstrated using an Arduino connected to a PC (serial terminal) to accurately control two motors; he was also able to demonstrate that the motors, although identical in every way, do not act identical and the work he did to get them to do so.  His finished goal is to build a stand-alone CNC circuit board (pcb) mill machine (of his own design).  (Here's a link to a hack-a-day example of something similar... http://hackaday.com/2009/11/23/cnc-circuit-board-fabrication/)

                                This month we will kick off by sharing with one another what pet projects we are working on and the status of these projects (idea, planning, in progress, testing, completed).   I can also confirm that more work has been done on Pete's project... he will be showing more of this work and discussing some of the design decisions, modifications, problems and solutions.

                                If we have time, we will continue working through some of the Arduino tutorials.

                                There will be pizza, so please RSVP so I know how much is needed.

                                See you there.

                                Plans fell through trying to secure a speaker that could cover ASP.NET vNEXT; so we are going to do something a little different this month.

                                For the last several years, we've done the same thing every November... a panel discussion with several industry experts in the DFW area; that, I am pleased to announce, is not changing.  However, what I'd like to be able to do is get everyone together to brainstorm a solid list of questions (mostly serious, but not necessarily all serious) for our panel meeting (again, November).  I think this will make for a better event and everyone will get more value out of it if we can hash these questions out ahead of time.  It will also assist me in finding the best possible panel (informative and entertaining wise) to work through those questions.

                                I’ve seen this approach played out in practice at several MVP events and, for the most part, it worked out better than the “ad-hoc” Q/A sessions.

                                As more and more companies make the move to the cloud there is a
                                growing concern with becoming too dependent on any one cloud provider. While
                                Azure, AWS and others provide the same basic set of services the APIs for
                                interacting with those services are all very different making it difficult for
                                developers to make their applications truly portable.

                                open-source framework that allows developers to build .NET-based applications
                                that are completely independent of the underlying cloud infrastructure. Through
                                a set of basic interfaces, Mantle provides a common foundation for hosting,
                                messaging and storage regardless of cloud platform.

                                community involvement and is a strong advocate of SOLID development practices.
                                Over the last eight years, he has been focused primarily on the .NET platform
                                but has recently taken a keen interest in cloud development both on Amazon's EC2
                                and Microsoft's Azure platform. Casey is heavily involved in the local
                                development community having spoken at several user groups and conferences

                        </h3>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                I have tried several different ways to build single-page web
                                applications over the last 3 years.  I started with iUI.  The concept was cool
                                but I quickly ran into road blocks.  I tried jQTouch and got a little farther
                                but again ran into road blocks.  jQueryMobile had just come out and I though
                                finally jQuery will get it right, but I spent all of my time fighting the
                                framework.  Then Knockout was released and it made things a lot better, but
                                there were still issues like url routing.  I started using a library called
                                SammyJS and that solved the routing issue.  My app was better, but I still
                                wasn’t happy with my view models.  They were way too big. It seemed like
                                everything was happening in the view model.  When I was finally able to get my
                                app working I started having trouble managing all of the JavaScript dependencies
                                and getting them loaded in the right order!  It was all just a big pain! Then
                                along came Durandal.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Durandal has solved all these problems and many more that I
                                didn’t even realize were going to be issues like JavaScript packaging and
                                minification, and application messaging just to name a couple.  Durandal
                                accomplishes all of this and it is fun to use. In this talk we will dive into
                                Durandal and the libraries that it sits on top of:  jQuery, RequireJS, Knockout,
                                and SammyJS.  At the end of this session you will walk away with the tools you
                                need to build an enterprise quality single-page web application.

                                from Microsoft in ASP.Net (WebForms, MVC, WebAPI, and SignalR -- what Microsoft
                                refers to as 'One ASP.Net') and put together a sample web application that uses
                                each of these frameworks in a cohesive solution.  Our discussion will define the
                                benefits and drawbacks of each framework, leading into a live coding session of

                                Onion Architecture is an architectural pattern for keeping
                                libraries and dependencies on the extremities of a software system while
                                building a strong and cohesive system core. Distributed systems like those that
                                leverage NServiceBus and Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) products have
                                characteristics that challenge the layering principles of non-distributed
                                systems. This session will show how to properly set up the structure and
                                layering of a .Net/C# software system that makes use of Onion Architecture,
                                NServiceBus, and ASP.NETMVC.  Beyond File-&gt;New Project, this talk walks

                                the run down on the most popular frameworks (Backbone, Knockout and Angular to
                                name a few). He'll also shed some light on how your server side code (and
                                mindset) needs to change to better support clients written in
                                dynamic/prototypical languages.

                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Have you ever stared a problem for 3-4 hours only to have someone
                                write down a 10 minute fix to solve it? That happened to me, and it lead me to
                                feverishly study design patterns. In that study I found 12 patterns that I
                                cannot live without. They help me solve complex problems in consistent ways and
                                give a framework for building huge functionality in very little code. In this
                                talk we will dive through the code and the patterns that can be applied to it so
                                that you can benefit that that study too. Repository, Specification, and 10 more
                                that are just as powerful will be where we start, but we may end by building the
                                ultimate pattern. Few people know, but patterns are like the power rangers. When
                                you combine them together you get something super powerful, and equally awesome!
