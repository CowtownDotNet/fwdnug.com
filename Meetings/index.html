                <h3>Topic:&nbsp; EF Core 1.0 – All Your Platforms Are Belong To Us</h3>
                <p>Welcome to the new .NET!  Gone are the days of Entity Framework being a 90% SQL Server solution, the new Entity Framework, called Entity Framework Core 1.0, will target multiple operating systems, multiple databases, and in all move EF boldly into the next generation of ORMs.  But it is a complete re-write, and v1 will have some very sharp corners where features will not be implemented.  You need to realize what it is ready for and what it is not.  Entity Framework v6 will be the norm for many enterprise apps, but now is the time to start learning EF Core so you’re ready when it is.</p>

                <h3>Topic:&nbsp; Functional Programming in F#</h3>
                <p>
                    The world operates in functions. Everyday we perform numerous small tasks that lead to some kind of output. That output is then used as an input to another task to produce a different output. Functional Programming is the practice of slicing a problem into smaller consumable units of work so that the connections of inputs to outputs can be pictured simply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will explore the fundamentals of thinking as a Functional Programmer, introduce key concepts of the F# language, code an F# solution quickly, and refactor for beautification and simplicity.

                <h3>Topic:&nbsp; Trust me, Azure event hubs are really cool!</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        With all the talk about big data, Internet of things, and the value that can be derived from the analysis of all of that information, no one seems to talk about how we collect it. There are a number of traditional ways. Those ways usually have problems with how to handle data spikes, durability, and distribution for processing. Azure Event Hubs may be an answer to part of those problems. We will go over what they are, how to set them up, the costs, and the various ways to send and receive information.

During that time he has done everything from running network cable, setting up various companies infrastructure from the absolute bare metal, and building line of business software for many of those companies. As passionate as he is about technology, you might happen to see him checking his air reserve while at a depth of 60 feet, cooking up a mean “free-range” fruit cake, doing pre-show table magic at the improv, or making a nice piece of wood into a lot of sawdust so my wife will have potting benches for her plants.

                <h3>Topic:&nbsp; The Git Parable</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Are you baffled by the community's obsession with Git? Do your knees tremble at the thought of encountering a merge conflict, or even worse: getting thrown into "detached head" state? When a new team says they're using Git, do you wonder why they're turning up their noses at the centralized VCS you know? Everybody understands adding, committing, pushing and pulling; but trying to understand Git with the same paradigm as you approach centralized version control systems is a recipe for fear, uncertainty & doubt. Git doesn't work like a centralized version control system, which can be confusing. If you want to understand how Git truly IS different, this session is for you. Git becomes much easier to understand, once you approach it with the understanding that it's fundamentally different from a centralized VCS. The goal of this talk is to shed some light on how Git works under the hood. To develop a mental model of how Git works, we'll start with, "The Git Parable," by Tom Preston-Warner. We'll take a look at some of Git’s core concepts including its basic object storage, how commits work, how branches and tags work, and we’ll look at the different kinds of merging in Git (yes, including rebase). You’ll walk away with a better understanding of these concepts, able to use Git with more confidence.

                    <p>
                        We will spend some time discussing what Windows 10 is and why it is important to get involved early with developing Universal Windows Applications (UWA). We will cover what it means to be a UWA application and what kinds of things can you do with UWA across desktop, tablet, phone, Xbox One, Hololens and even the Raspberry Pi 2... to name but a few devices that UWA currently targets.

In this specific application, I transitioned from pure WinForms to a hybrid application leveraging Portable Class Libraries (PCL). Because of this I not only was able to transition between these different platforms, I am able to continue supporting all of them from within Visual Studio 2015.

                <div>
                    <p>
                        If you are paying close attention to the front-end web development space, you have probably heard of things like Gulp and Grunt.
                        Both are build systems/tasks runners. These sound terribly boring but in reality they are very handy tools.
                        In this meetup we will focus on using one of them (Gulp) and how it can help us solve a number of problems in web development.
                        Along the way we'll also discuss Node, NPM, Bower, JSX, Typescript, ES6, Browserify, Web Pack, SASS, JavaScript unit-testing automation, et al.
                        So if you aren't already familiar with all these tools, I'll show you how you can use them to help you in your web development.

                <h3>Topic:&nbsp; Clean View Models </h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        You've seen them. Those really big view models that take on far too much responsibility. They send messages to other view models, they call services, and they run business logic. It's really hard to understand how these things work, and even harder to avoid breaking them when they need to change.

                        See how the message bus pattern -- far from its original intent -- is actually coupling your view models. See why business logic always seems to end up in the wrong layer. And most importantly, learn a better alternative.

                        Writing clean view models is easy, but only if you have the tools to help you.

                        Software is math. Michael L Perry has built upon the works of mathematicians like Bertrand Meyer, Leslie Lamport, and Donald Knuth to develop a mathematical system for software development. He has captured this system in a set of open source projects, Assisticant and Correspondence. He teaches this system in the Q.E.D. Code podcast, and on several Pluralsight courses including Cryptography Fundamentals and Patterns for Building Distributed Systems for the Enterprise. As a Principal Consultant at Improving Enterprises, he applies mathematical concepts to building scalable and robust enterprise systems. You can find out more at qedcode.com.

                <h3>Topic:&nbsp; ASP.NET 5 (vNext)</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Web development was a different game back in the early 2000s. Early versions of ASP.NET were aimed at Microsoft's existing customer base, and even tried to hide the nature of the web from developers who weren't ready for it. The platform has evolved steadily since the .NET Framework was released, but many of the technical decisions made early in ASP.NET's life don't make sense in the context of modern web development. By cutting loose some of the baggage from earlier versions, the ASP.NET team has been able to make sweeping changes to bring the framework in line with its lightweight, agile contemporaries. In this presentation, Brian will show how the next version of ASP.NET will be leaner and more flexible than the platform has ever been. Topics covered will include the new command line tools, changes to Visual Studio, cross-platform usage, tag helpers, view components, and more.

                    <p>
                        Brian Sullivan is a principal consultant for Improving Enterprises in Dallas. He got his start in programming maintaining legacy mainframe applications in COBOL at a large trucking company, but quickly realized he needed to find a more productive environment in order to stay sane. He jumped at the opportunity to help transition some of those COBOL applications to .NET, and he hasn’t looked back since. He has been working with Microsoft technologies since the .NET 1.0 days, and is interested in introducing modern web development techniques to the clients he works with. Brian is recipient of the Microsoft MVP award in ASP.NET and a graduate of Harding University.

                    <p>
                        Netduino is an open source electronics platform using the .NET Micro Framework. We keep hearing that March is for Makers, so for this month's meeting we are going to build something using a Netduino, a few components, and Visual Studio. We will have a few Netduinos on-hand for those interested in following along. If you already own a Netduino, we encourage you to bring yours as there will not be enough to go around.<br />
                        <br />
                        To follow along, you will need to bring a laptop with the following installed:<br />
                        <ul>

                            <li><a href="http://netmf.codeplex.com/">NET Micro Framework SDK v4.3 (QFE2-RTM)</a></li>
                        </ul>
                        <br />
                        We will be providing the hardware components needed for the hands-on lab.<br />
                        There is also a pretty good chance that we will be giving a Netduino away!

                        Xamarin allows you to put your C# expertise to work on Android and iOS. Previously, you had to know Objective-C and Java to write native applications. Xamarin apps are built with standard, native user interface controls. Apps look and behave as users expect them.

                <div>
                    <p>
                        At this year's Microsoft Connect() event in New York City, Scott Guthrie gave
                        developers all over the world a quick taste of Visual Studio 2015 and C# 6. In
                        this hands-on session, Casey Watson digs a little bit deeper and goes into even
                        greater detail about what these updates mean to you. Included in this session
                        will be a demonstration of some of the debugging improvements that have been
                        made in Visual Studio 2015, "Smart Unit Tests" and some great new C# language
                        features. If you are interested in the future of development with Visual Studio
                        you owe it to yourself to attend this session. If you would like to follow
                        along, be sure to grab Visual Studio 2015 for free at

                        Casey Watson is a dedicated husband, proud father, community organizer and
                        Senior Program Manager at Microsoft. Casey believes that is the responsibility
                        of every serious developer to constantly "sharpen their saw" through both
                        reading and community involvement and is a strong advocate of SOLID development
                        practices. Over the last decade, he has been focused primarily on the .NET
                        platform but has recently focused on building cloud-based applications on the
                        Microsoft Azure platform. Casey is heavily involved in the local development
                        community having spoken at and organized several user groups and conferences
                        across the United States including Cowtown Code Camp, Dallas TechFest and Tulsa
                        TechFest. When not learning about, speaking on, writing about or building
                        software, he can be found spending time with his family, updating his Twitter
                        status (@_caseywatson), or enjoying an ice cold bottle of Blue Moon.
